      "description": "A dark black woman in a large white dress with a ruffled petticoat and a large, broad-brimmed hat with a white ribbon hatband walks away from the viewer on the beach. Two empty white shoes are in the viewer's right foreground. One shoe's opening faces the viewer and the other shoe leans upwards with its laces visibly untied. The woman is wearing a bow round her waist that is solid light blue one side with large blue polka-dots on the other side, in a field of white. Her dress has three buttons on the back and a fancy collar. The heels of both bare feet of the woman are visible as her right foot is placed in front of her, she picks up her left foot behind. Her left elbow is visible above her billowing dress. In front of her a blue sea swells. At her feet two-colors of sand show the shadow of her dress in the bright and direct sun.

      "description": "A young dark-skinned girl in a pinafore type dress with short, cuffed sleeves is looking away from the viewer in the foreground. She is center-right in the painting. She has a white bow in her hair, which appears to be somewhat wavy with highlights of brown and undertoens of dark brown and black. Her hair is cropped relatively short in a style indicative of a childhood haircut of mid-Twentieth Century America. Her dress appears to be picked up slightly by the wind, filling the bottom eighth of the painting. She is facing a large white sheet on a clothesline that is blowing gently in the breeze. The sheet is blown up just enough to see the grass and shadows peeking through below it. Above the sheet, at the top a clear blue sky peeks through, slightly lighter blue on the left. Direct sharp lighting indicates mid morning or noon light.",

      "description": "Catfish Row aka Cabbage Row\nCabbage Row is a structure from the Revolutionary War era. It is a well preserved example of this type of home, consisting of a pair of houses connected by a central arcade. The structure is three stories tall with commercial ground floors that have stood the test of time. The area is now lined with private homes and specialty shops but that wasn\u2019t always the case.\nAt one time, Cabbage Row was home to up to ten families at a time and was mostly inhabited by the African American families of freed slaves. This is also where the name, Cabbage Row, was born. African Americans living in these row houses would sell cabbage right from their window sills. The building continued to house a tenement into the early 1900s. Name was changed for Catfish Row based on Gershwin\u2019s opera, Porgy and Bess.",

A white clapboard corn shed with a red roof is just behind the mule and easily seen  above the fence. It is located just right of center in the painting and has its door opened slightly inwards revealing the darkness inside. A leafy tree is just behind and to the right of the shed. In the far distance there is a small white house with green shutters and a red roof. The front porch on the house sways downward. Behind the house there is a small patch of leafy trees. In front of it, in the distance behind eth house, is another small patch of leafy trees. The sky above is blue tinged with red. A sliver of a moon is just above and left of the house. Stars are also in the sky. Some clouds are visible as it appears to be near dawn or sunset. The fence in the foreground is covered with a series of interesting shadows that appear to be from light filtering through trees.",

There are no prior or later editions in this series of original prints.\n",

      "description": "Now worth 60,000 as of April 25, 2005\nDECORATION DAY\n\nDecoration Day was observed by many small communities in the South following the end of the Civil War to remember and honor those who lost their lives during this war.  It also served as a time for many in small communities throughout South Carolina to fulfill a general human need to honor all those had passed.  Graves were often decorated and members of the community gathered for a sense of fellowship combined with picnics and related celebrations.\n\nAccording to Professor David Blight of the Yale University History Department, \u201cthe first Decoration Day (Memorial Day) was observed by formerly enslaved black people at the Washington Race Course (today the location of Hampton Park in Charleston, South Carolina.)  The race course had been used as a temporary Confederate prison camp in 1865 as well as a mass grave for Union soldiers who died there.  Immediately after the cessation of hostilities, formerly enslaved people exhumed the bodies from the mass grave and reinterred them properly with individual graves.  They built a fence around the graveyard with an entry arch and declared it a Union graveyard.  The work was completed in only ten days.  On May, 1, 1865, The Charleston newspaper reported that a crowd of up to ten thousand, mainly black residents, including 2800 children, processed to the location for a celebration which included sermons, singing, and a picnic on the grounds, thereby creating the first Decoration Day.\u201d\n\nAfter the government incorporated Decoration Day into a Federal Memorial Day to honor all individuals who served and died during all American wars and changed the observation day and date to assure a three day week-end the specific meaning of Decoration Day began to fade.  Jonathan Green created the painting Decoration Day because this was still observed by his family and community members when he was a child.  Many children of today however do not understand the history of Decoration Day and the unique meaning it had to African-Americans in the South.",

The dress has a faint damask-like pattern in it and also has bright white eyelet on the hem, at the bust line and at the end of the dress\u2019 buttoned-down balloon sleeves. The woman is swinging forcefully on a tree swing at an angle in the opposite direction of the viewer. The scene captures the moment at which the dress fills with air and fans out, creating a poppy-like shape around the woman\u2019s body.\n\nThe swinging woman\u2019s face is completely obscured by her hat. Shadows on the top of the hat echo the tree above her and show the intensity of the sun. White ribbon flows from beneath the hat, and lead to a white bow that his around her neck. The woman holds a substantial rope in each hand. She wears brilliant white socks with red ribbons in them that match her dress. The sky around her legs and socks is blue with a few white, puffy clouds. Tree branches and leaves frame the top of the image, hinting again at the tree upon which the swing hangs.\n\nIn the distance behind the swinging woman a patch of green grass and a small old style house with shutters and a front porch are visible.",

The mule's tail is brushed slightly to the left and the mule has its head placed down near the ground, turned slightly to the left so that you can see its ele and ears. It appears to be eating grass but noticing the viewer. In the distance to the left of the gray mule in the foreground a large brown mule is munching grass. To the left of the brown mule is a small tree with three trunk segments. To the right of the gray mule is a larger tree (live oak?) in the distance. In the far distance the flat green field appears to meet with some low dark green hills. The shadows are short indicating that the image is near noon time. The sky is blue with strands of white puffy clouds.",

The pallete knife technique is very clear in these paintings. This painting shows three inflorescences with three stems. On the left, behind the central inflorescence, there is an inflorescence with four alternate bracts. In the center of the painting a series of three stems make a V-shape. There are two stems on the left of the central inflorescence and one large stem on the right. One of the two stems on the left continues out of the image and the other appears to be broken off.  The central inflorescence is made of four alternate bracts. Behind the large stem on the right is a smaller inflorescence made up of two alternate bracts. The shadow behind the flowers is harsh and suggests a light sources from the immediate right of the painting and a background near the flowers.

      "description": "A view of a dirt or gravel road as it curves from the right top to the left bottom of the painting from tree-level above the road. The road is dotted in brownish specks and is deeply rutted down the center. The sky at the top of the painting is dark blue and a white full moon is rising in a partly cloudy sky in the far distance. A bright red fence lines the road on both sides, following its curve. Behind the fence on the left side there are four (apple?) trees with delicate green leaves and purple trunks. A mass of the same kind of trees are also located behind the red fence on the left side of the road. In the distance, beneath the rising moon, a pale white/bluish truck (Jeep?) is making its way down the road. The truck's bed is obscured by trees and a reflection on the window renders the driver invisible. The landscape in the distance is flat and grassy, dotted with shadows from the brilliant moonlight.",

The fence is covered in shadows like dappled light through the trees and it reflects the red-pink of the sky. A red bucket hangs on the left fencepost leaning with its top opening towards the right. The mule is wearing a yellow blinder. The field in which the mule stands is full of tall swirling grass and has three (live oak?) trees -- one near, one farther away to the left and one farthest away to the left. The shadows are directly under the trees. The sky is brilliant red and tinged with blue. In the field to the left of the mule a red rooster struts with two chickens in attendance -- one blue and one yellow.",

The woman is viewed from the back and is looking out over the marshes and out to the sea.  She is wearing a white dress with a blue horizontal trim near the hem of the dress, and she is holding in her left arm a large sweetgrass basket.  She is also wearing a sweetgrass hat with a white trim near the brim of the hat.  There are floating young white thunderclouds developing in the sky.  The thunderclouds are reflected in the marsh waters.  The painting has an outstanding balance and the atmosphere is one of silence and space.",

      "description": "This is the 3rd painting in a series of 4 surrealistic paintings created to reflect an abstract esoteric spirit of a head floating over the marshland waters.  The cool atmosphere of the painting is enhanced by the blue water with the blue head of a man whose bottom portion of the face is over the blue water and the upper head of the face is in front of green marshland grasses.  There are two colorful blue and red birds of paradise with yellow heads flying towards the floating head.  One bird appears to be approaching the nostril of the floating head.  The result evokes an eerie mood of a quiet ever present mysterious spirit rising from the marshlands.",

      "description": "Robert Smalls (April 5, 1839 \u2013 February 23, 1915) was an enslaved African American who, during and after the American Civil War, became a ship's pilot, sea captain, and politician. He freed himself, his crew and their families from slavery on May 13, 1862, by commandeering a Confederate transport ship, the CSS Planter, in Charleston harbor, and sailing it to freedom beyond the Federal blockade. His example and persuasion helped convince President Lincoln to accept African-American soldiers into the Union Army. Smalls was born in Beaufort, South Carolina. After the American Civil War, he became a politician, winning election to the South Carolina State legislature and the United States House of Representatives. As a politician, Smalls authored state legislation providing for South Carolina to have the first free and compulsory public school system in the United States, and founded the Republican Party of South Carolina. He was the lastRepublican to represent South Carolina's 5th congressional district until 2010.",

She is almost blue black and her brilliant dark skin is highlighted by a string of white pearls around her neck.  She is wearing a gold circle earring.  There is a small yellow butterfly resting on her left shoulder.  There is a field of green grass seen between the sheets that serve as a background to highlight her dress.  There is a hint of a blue sky with scattered white clouds in the upper right edge of the painting creating a sense of depth and space.  Just below the skyline there is one lone wooden clothes pin holding one of the sheets on the line.  The painting is signed in the lower right corner of the painting.",

      "description": "Built in: 1840 Remodeled in: 1893\nThe Tabernacle, a meeting house and lecture room, was built by Beaufort Baptist Church in 1840s, perhaps on site of a praise house built before 1832. On 1 September 1863, Tabernacle Baptist Church was organized by the Rev. Soloman Peck of Boston, Massachusetts, with much of its 500 member African-American congregation coming from the Beaufort Baptist Church. The new congregation acquired this building and continues to use it for worship. Damaged in the hurricane of 1893, it was rebuilt and rededicated. The cemetery contains graves of Bythewood family (the earliest dating to 1817) suggesting an early-19th century burial ground occupies site. A memorial to Robert Smalls is also located in the cemetery where Smalls and his first wife Hannah are buried. Robert Smalls (1839-1915), was born into slavery. In 1862, while working as part of the slave crew of the Confederate steamer \u201cThe Planter,\u201d Smalls managed to capture the ship and turn it over to Union forces. After the war, his distinguished career of public service included election to the South Carolina House of Representatives (1868-1870) and Senate (1870-1875), as well as four terms in the U. S. House of Representatives (1875-1879, 1882-1887). Smalls also served as a major general in the state militia and later served as Port Collector for Beaufort.",

Her left hand is on her left hip and her left arm is somewhat obscured to the forearm by her round hip. The cord from the microphone seems to go to the unseen left hand as it makes a loop from her left hip straight up the middle of the front of her body to the microphone. The woman's eyes are closed. She is wearing large yellow hoop earrings grey eyeshadow and red lipstick. Her mouth is open and her eyes are closed. Approximately one-third of her 60s style hairdo is cut off at the top of the painting. The woman's ample hips continue to the bottom of the painting, which stops just above where her knees might be. In the lower background, a dark round shadow looms. In the upper background a pattern (wallpaper? Stage design?) of bright red paisley-shapes are on a field of bright blue. The stage lighting is harsh and from the front.",

Jonathan Green painted an initial study of Dance Hall Romance in gouache on paper, which guided th emaking of hand cut and painted stencils used in the printing. Eighteen layers of silkscreen inks were used in the printing of this silkscreen. The preliminary study for this print was returned to Jonathan Green Studios, Inc. for its archival files.

Her left hand is on her left hip and her left arm is somewhat obscured to the forearm by her round hip. The cord from the microphone seems to go to the unseen left hand as it makes a loop from her left hip straight up the middle of the front of her body to the microphone. The woman's eyes are closed. She is wearing large yellow hoop earrings grey eyeshadow and red lipstick. Her mouth is open and her eyes are closed. Approximately one-third of her 60s style hairdo is cut off at the top of the painting. The woman's ample hips continue to the bottom of the painting, which stops just above where her knees might be. In the lower background, a dark round shadow looms. In the upper background a pattern (wallpaper? Stage design?) of bright red paisley-shapes are on a field of bright blue. The stage lighting is harsh and from the front.",

The cord from the microphone seems to go to the unseen left hand as it makes a loop from her left hip straight up the middle of the front of her body to the microphone. The woman's eyes are closed. She is wearing large yellow hoop earrings grey eyeshadow and red lipstick. Her mouth is open and her eyes are closed. Approximately one-third of her 60s style hairdo is cut off at the top of the painting. The woman's ample hips continue to the bottom of the painting, which stops just above where her knees might be. In the lower background, a dark round shadow looms. In the upper background a pattern (wallpaper? Stage design?) of bright red paisley-shapes are on a field of bright blue. The stage lighting is harsh and from the front.",

There is a hint of rich green grass in the foreground and a slight vertical slip of the sky in the upper background seen through a break in the hanging sheets.

Both sheets are being blown by the wind. A (?willow) branch helps bolster the laundry line. The sheet on the left is trimmed in yellow while the sheet on the right is trimmed in teal ribbon. Both sheets are waving very high in the wind.  Dark green topography is in the far distance. Highly defined shadows beneath the sheets and the woman's dress indicate that it is near noontime.",
